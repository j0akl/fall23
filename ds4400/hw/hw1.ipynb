    "The 442 instances of data in this dataset represent information about people with diabetes. The target variable in this dataset is a number which represents progression of the disease in the year after a baseline value was collected. Ensuring that data points are easy to use, ex. ensuring all numerical points are represented as numbers instead of strings, will be important in preprocessing. I would like to do regressions from each individual data point to the target variable using scatter plots to see which may be the most descriptive features. Correlation matricies will be helpful in this instance as well, as I suspect many of these features may be related to one another."
